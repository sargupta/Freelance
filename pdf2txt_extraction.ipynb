Moreover, it has already being submitted to the SME-Instrument Ph.2 call and it was granted the Seal of Excellence with a score of 13.39 (No 812053). Since then, we have worked to strenghten our project to assure we harness this business opportunity correctly. We have better studied the profile of our target clients, designed more realistic market-entering strategies specific for each client segment, and we have enhanced the scalability of our business model.    \f     PAGE |2  INTRODUCTION Basic information  Company description GeoSLab (legal full name of GeoSpatiumLab SL) is a high-tech Spanish SME specialized in digital processing and modelling of geospatial and georeferenced information and in the development of advanced software and mobile Apps with an especial focus on water and farm management.  To guarantee the interoperability and scalability of our solutions, we work following international standards such as the INSPIRE Directive. Thus, our developments can function on their own or together with other software building more potent and integrated systems.  We have a wide portfolio of clients, ranging from public authorities (Hydrographic confederations and Spanish national and regional bodies) to private companies (mainly environmental consultancy or engineering companies). We develop ad-hoc solutions for these entities (e.g. we are the developers of the water information systems of Oman and of the Spanish region of Álava) as well as we develop our own-solutions to be commercially exploited by us. An example is AGROSLAB, a web platform to support farmers with the application of pesticides and fertilizers on farms and support on regulatory requirements of the CAP. It already has more than 12,000 users and its being a complete success: since its market launch in 2014, revenues generated have grown exponentially (e.g. by 60 % between 2017 and 2018).  Summary  Description of the innovation Farming is a complex activity, strictly regulated, that suffers from many risks (weather events…). As in any business, farmers aim at obtaining the highest profit, by making an optimized input use (water, fertilizer…) whilst complying with the regulation.  Lately there have arisen different ICT tools to ease farm management (e.g. smart irrigation systems). However, the lack of integration, homogenization and interoperability hinders the full exploitation of the smart farming concept.  With SMARTQUA, we are bringing the smart farming concept to the next level. Our solution represents digitally and resolves the complexity of farming sector. Based on the concept of meta-platform, it (i) integrates different platforms, (ii) gathers information from the farm and from external sources and (iii) runs advanced simulation models, to solve in an efficient manner main farmers’ pain points.  The advantages of SMARTQUA include:  1. Accurate irrigation management that reaches 35 % water savings, which means 25 % savings in energy and fertilizers.  2. Ad-hoc risk mitigation plans to reduce losses by 50 % (e.g. selection of the most appropriate crops according to water availability forecasts).  3. Hassle-free compliance with EU regulation by providing the mechanisms and recommendations to comply with it.   Relation of the innovation with the overall strategy of the beneficiary SMARTQUA is fully aligned with GeoSLab’s strategy, as this project will allow us to capitalize the knowledge and expertise obtained previously in geodata management, use of highly advanced predictive models for environmental, agronomic and climatic risk assessment and design and implementation of information systems. All these elements: data from sensors, remote sensing, official sources… + predictive models + other specialized software; are key components of SMARTQUA that now will work together for a science-based solution that is at the same time, user-friendly and comprehensive.   As a result, we will deliver to the market a cost-efficient and high-performance meta-platform for farmers that will outperform current solutions in the market and will democratize the access to and sharing of knowledge. The development and marketing of SMARTQUA will have a strong impact in our company. The commercialization of this new solution will be translated into fast company growth and market positioning in the sector of smart farming systems. Thanks to SMARTQUA we will consolidate our national and international expansion, as we will reach different EU countries (mainly Spain, Italy, Portugal, France and Greece) and Latin America. Moreover, our company’s EBITDA will increase from nearly 150 k€ (2018) to more than 1 M€ (2024) thanks to the exploitation of SMARTQUA. \f     PAGE |3  1. EXCELLENCE 1.1 Idea and solution The relevance of farming The EU’s agricultural sector is of vital importance for our society: it guarantees food security for over 500 million European citizens and creates 22 million jobs directly and 44 million indirectly1. Due to their great importance, almost 40 % of the EU’s budget is allocated to support farming through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), that subsidizes farming through direct payments and other payment schemes.  The complexity of farming Farming is a highly complex activity, in which multiple factors must be taken into account. Main PAIN POINTS faced by farmers are:   Low income: despite the utmost importance of farming, overall farming is not a highly profitable business. Indeed, the average farmers’ income is around 40% lower compared to non-agricultural income2. In this context, it is of vital importance for farmers to make the best possible allocation of resources (i.e. optimize use of inputs such as irrigation water, fertilizers, energy, pesticides…) in order to maximize yield while assuring the profitability of the business.   Risk management: farming is also a risky activity, as it is strongly affected by unforeseen weather events (droughts, frost…), volatile prices, natural disasters, pests and diseases. As a result, every year one fifth of farmers suffer an income drop of 30 %1.   Strict regulation: EU farming has one of the strictest regulations worldwide. In order to receive direct payments, farmers must comply with the CAP’s cross-compliance requisites which are related to 18 legislative requirements (e.g. Nitrates Directive, Sustainable Use of Pesticides…) and “good agricultural and environmental conditions” (e.g. conservation of soil’s organic matter to avoid erosion). As a result, farmers must watch out each and every operation they carry out: irrigation, fertilization, pesticides use, land management… in order to comply with the EU regulation and receive direct payments. The smart farming revolution presents usability problems for farmers In the last years, there have arisen a multitude of smart solutions and ICT tools aimed at easing farm management: smart irrigation systems, SW platforms for pesticides or fertilizers use and keep a track record of applications, information systems about the status (quantity and quality) of water reservoirs…  These solutions are intended to be helpful for farmers, but we have reached to a point in which options available are so diverse, that they could even become a burden for farmers that need to deal with many different tools and Apps, each with a different purpose. There is a lack of integration and interoperability, which ultimately results in a lack of user-friendly solutions and an obstacle to fully exploit the smart farming potential.   Our solution SMARTQUA Our solution SMARTQUA is a meta-platform or, in another words, a platform of platforms. Based on geolocation and dynamic transfer of key elements related to agronomic production, it brings the smart farming concept to the next level. To do so, we integrate different platforms with a proven track record, gather in-field and external information (e.g. soil properties, EU regulation in force…) and make use of advanced simulation models. This way, we offer farmers the first one-stop-shop digital platform of platforms where they can find in a single place the tools that they need for an efficient farm management. It is an expert system that generates new knowledge and value at an exponential rate.  Simply put, SMARTQUA transfer to a digital dimension all the elements, relationships and balances found in an agricultural system, with the aim of enhancing farmers’ competitiveness whilst minimizing the environmental impact.                                                               1 European Commission (2017). The future of Food and Farming. LINK.  2 European Commission (2019). The common agricultural policy at a glance. LINK.  Figure 1. SMARTQUA digitalizes farms and puts them in the palm of your hand \f     PAGE |4  The services that will be first provided by SMARTQUA are divided in three pillars below explained, each addressing one of our clients’ (i.e. farmers) main pain points.  PILLAR 1: Irrigation and fertilization management for an optimized input use (water, energy and fertilizers).  SMARTQUA calculates accurately irrigation doses, frequency and timing, contributing to a significant reduction on input optimization. Based on trials done in real farms (further explain in section 1.4 “feasibility and risks”), we have proven water savings of more than 35 %, which is translated into energy savings of 25 % (as less energy is required to pump the water) and fertilizer savings of 25 % (as optimal irrigation doses mean that there is not a generation of surplus water that would drain down and wash nutrients). Considering water and energy prices in a Mediterranean country like Spain, up to 550 €/ha can be saved per year thanks to the implementation of our solution.   For farmers having/willing to have an automatic irrigation controller with internet connectivity (IoT), thanks to the interoperability of tour system we offer the possibility of connecting our platform with the controller, so that the recommendations provided by SMARTQUA are directly sent to the controller and farmers don’t need to bother to program it manually.  PILLAR 2: Risk mitigation to minimize losses.  SMARTQUA monitors potential risks both weather related (drought, frost, pests…) and market related (drops on prices due to overproductions) and the likelihood of them happening so action can be taken on time and losses can be reduced by 50 %. Some practical examples of the application of this functionality are:   RISK: Drought forecast  SOLUTION: by analysing with advanced simulation models information coming from weather generators, status of water reservoirs, climatic scenarios and expected water demand on the region, SMARTQUA calculates water availability during the growing season so that periods of drought can be seen in advance to plan the season accordingly. This is translated into the selection of drought-resistant varieties/crops and the optimal seeding density.   RISK: Price fluctuations  SOLUTION: by analysing global harvest forecasts (prices & yield) and crops’ cost structure (inputs and labour required); SMARTQUA recommends the best crops to be planted according to a cost-effectiveness criterion (i.e. crops that would yield the maximum profit in the market, considering costs incurred during its production).    RISK: Alerts  SOLUTION: by monitoring in-real time environmental factors affecting farming (temperature, humidity…) crops being grown, pesticides treatments applied… SMARTQUA foresees the appearance of sudden risks such as pests or frost and provides a customized mitigation plan; so that farmers can apply it right on time.   PILLAR 3: Hassle-free compliance with the EU regulation SMARTQUA monitors all the EU regulation affecting farming and provides farmers the mechanisms and recommendations to comply with it:   Nitrates Directive (91/676/ECC), aimed at protecting water against nitrates pollution from agricultural sources and whose compliance is mandatory in order to receive fully CAP’s direct payments. One of the main cause of nitrates pollution is the use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers, as nitrates forming in the soil would leach with the drainage water and reach water bodies. Because SMARTQUA tells the exact amount of water required in each moment, this minimizes the amount of drainage water by 70%. Consequently, nitrates leaching is negligible and compliance with the Nitrates Directive is guaranteed. To validate our solution, an independent certification body will certify that SMARTQUA avoids nitrates pollution, so that farmers using our solution can be confident that by following SMARTQUA recommendations, they would meet the cross-compliance requirements regarding the Nitrates Directive.  Sustainable use of Pesticides Directive (2009/128). SMARTQUA tells the best amount and moment to apply a pesticide, keeps a track record of pesticides applied and warns about the “security time-frame” (i.e. days between an application and harvest time) and any other regulatory issue stated in the EU Directive 2009/128 for a sustainable management of pesticide use and the correspondent national regulations. Since compliance with the above-mentioned regulation is also mandatory in order to meet the cross-compliance criteria, this functionality is also key to perceive entirely the CAP direct payments.  \f     PAGE |5  This functionality will be powered through the implementation of the own-developed tool AGROSLAB, that already has more than 12,200 users in Spain.  Other regulations affecting specific farms. There are other regulations that apply only to certain farms (e.g. if a farmer is receiving payments from CAP’s second pillar regarding “agri-environment-climate” measures or placed within the Natura 2000 areas among others, he/she will have stricter limitations regarding pesticides and other inputs use). With SMARTQUA we monitor all regulations that apply specifically to each farm and keep farmers updated, in a comprehensive manner, of each and every regulatory issue that they must consider.  The potential of our solution is recognized by several public and private entities (see Letters of Interest from 14 stakeholders in Annex 3) and has been proven under real environmental conditions during the Feasibility Study conducted during the Phase 1. Certification of SMARTQUA to enhance farmers’ willingness to buy and competitiveness  SMARTQUA’s capabilities to reduce the environment impact of agriculture will be certified under an independent certification body. Based on the “Codes of Good Agricultural Practices” published by the Ministries of Agriculture of the different EU countries, we will identify measures to which SMARTQUA contributes positively (mainly related to water savings, fertilizer savings and nitrates pollution prevention). For each measure identified, we will establish target values (e.g. less than 600 m3 of water per tonne of maize produced or no more than 50 kg/ha of complex NPK 15:15:15 fertilizer) and the external certification body will audit the validation of SMARTQUA to achieve these target values (during Task 3.6).  This will result in a “quality seal” granted by an acknowledged certification body, recognized by farmers and stakeholders of the farming sector.  This will increase our target clients’ willingness to pay for SMARTQUA as this certification will:   Enhance farmers’ trust in the potential of our solution, as the outcomes delivered by our solution would have been validated by an external body  Increase farmers’ competitiveness as large retailers that lead the food market are the more and more seeking for agricultural products produced in sustainable manner, in order to meet consumers’ demands of environmentally friendly food products.   DNV GL (Norwegian) and TÜV Rheinland (German), certification bodies operating each in more than 100 countries, have already positively assessed the feasibility of this certification.   Future developments SMARTQUA’s capabilities are unlimited, as our aim is to progressively develop and integrate new functionalities to facilitate dynamic learning and adaptation to changing conditions of market markets, climate or regulation among others. The agri-food sector is undergoing a revolution enabled by the application of ICT technologies to farming. Smart tractors, drones, technology 4.0, augmented reality… are some examples that are changing the landscape of farming. We are aware that we are targeting a very dynamic sector and that, in order to stay ahead of the competition, is key to stay updated and incorporate the latest trends into our solution. In this sense, SMARTQUA itself is a dynamic platform in which we are considering the implementation of further functionalities that would enhance continuously the valued delivered by our solution. Some examples in our roadmap are:   Integration with smart tractors (Figure 2), that track land operations such as pesticides treatments (type of pesticide applied and dose) so that the mandatory track record of pesticides treatments is automatically created, and farmers don’t need to introduce the data manually.   Use of drones, artificial intelligence and augmented reality capabilities to map farms, detect key points and fix them (Figure 3). For example, different colouring of crops is an indicator of uneven nutrients intake by plants. Considering that average farm size in the EU is of 16 ha, it is extremely difficult to detect accurately these differences at ground level and by the human-eye, Figure 2. Tractors are becoming increasingly complex Figure 3. Drones & augmented reality opens a whole new world for farming \f     PAGE |6  but with the application of drones and artificial intelligence even slight changes of colour can be spotted, so that corrective measures can be applied (i.e. level the land, change fertigation program…) to maximize yield. The advanced processing of geolocated information contributes decisively to boost “maximum precision agriculture”. In addition, as of the third year in the market, we will launch the business intelligence service. It will target companies and banks that offer agricultural insurances to farmers to protect their crops against weather or other risks. For these companies, it is of utmost important to know the likelihood of a risk happening in order to charge the most cost-effective price to farmers. SMARTQUA business intelligence service will offer accurate reports, covering different crops and risks (drought, frost, hail…) and specific for each region (the actual content of each report will be defined by each client).  How is SMARTQUA delivered? As we further explain in section 2, SMARTQUA’s users can choose among three different subscription options: FREE BASIC PREMIUM Free 0.80 €/ha & month First 5 years: 5.5 €/ha & month Onwards: 1.25 €/ha & month Fees will be paid under yearly subscriptions. Non-customized recommendations based on open data. Non-customized recommendations based on agronomical and hydrological models, depending on regional data and conditions. Fully customized recommendations for farm management, taking into account information gathered from the field. According to our calculations, approximately 60 % of our users will be free, 25 % basic and 15 % premium. Even though free users don’t provide directly a revenue, it is highly interesting to have them within our platform, as they create critical mass and we can leverage the data provided by them (farm location, crops being grown…) to offer further services based on Big Data analyses. Indeed, from the third year in the market we will launch the “business intelligent services” revenue stream. It targets agricultural insurance companies and banks offering insurance coverage to farmers, that would benefit from detail reports through which they can know the likelihood of a risk happening and adjust insurances’ prices accordingly.  How does SMARTQUA work? SMARTQUA platform uses data from different external sources and from the farm, and digests it through already developed tools and making use of agronomic, hydrological and climatic simulation models. All input data is processed following the INSPIRE Directive (2007/2/EC) (data sharing, interoperatibility and standardisation) to ensure that data is compatible and usable. In the following chart, we show a schematic representation of SMARTQUA functioning:   \f     PAGE |7  How is SMARTQUA deployed? For BASIC and PREMIUM users SMARTQUA offers a personalized service (ad-hoc for each farm). To do so, its commissioning requires a process of deployment and calibration of simulation models that consists on the following:   Placing of sensors. Selection 1-2 points per hectare to place soil humidity sensors (only for calibration purposes).   Soil hydraulic properties. Soil sampling (1-2 per ha) and laboratory analyses to determine its texture, organic matter content and density and, based in these properties and by making use of pedotransfer functions, obtain the soil hydraulic properties (i.e. the behaviour of water in the soil such as moisture retention).   Coupling with the smart irrigation controller already in-place (if available).   Data analysis and calibration of the simulation models. During a whole growing season, the simulation models will be calibrated by comparing data from the sensors and delivered from the models themselves. This is done remotely from our premises in Spain. Once the system is calibrated, the sensors can be removed.   Training of farmers on SMARTQUA. To that aim, we will create tutorial videos in the local language. To offer such a personalized service, technical personnel in the field will be required. Hence, to guarantee the scalability and international expansion of SMARTQUA, we will create an international network of local partners that will support us on the deployment of SMARTQUA and also will carry out commercial activities (engaging and following-up farmers). 1.2 Innovativeness Our unique approach Our approach is based on providing a highly-advanced tool at a competitive price. In SMARTQUA we make use of the most up to date tools, simulation models and geospatial processing of all variables and parameters that affect farming management.  The key innovation of SMARTQUA is the integration and dynamic interoperability of own-developed and existing tools with a wide curated and high-quality array of information in the frame of a meta-platform. In our company we’ve been working for 12 years on developing information systems, mainly based on the concept of Spatial Data Infrastructures, for key players such as Governments (e.g. Oman), local authorities or private entities. Now we have integrated all this know-how in the design and development of SMARTQUA to provide farmers access to a reliable system adapted to their specific conditions but at the same time connected in a global network. We are leveraging the power of the information and data available (status of water reservoirs, weather information, harvest forecasts…) and tools already developed which are currently underexploited.  By crossing all this information with the specific situation of each farm, and using advanced simulation models, we are able to offer high level consultancy services at a very low cost.   This way, the agri-food chain will become more competitive, resilient, environmentally friendly and better connected to the markets thanks to significant savings in water, energy and fertilizers and larger and better-quality harvests. Beyond the State of the art In the state-of-the-art there are different platforms related with the smart farming concept, which are either public or private initiatives. Each of them addresses a different pain point faced by farmers, but none use a holistic approach to offer in a single platform an integrated solution as we do. Below, we highlight some of these solutions in the state-of-the-art:  IRRIFRAME (public initiative from the ministry of agriculture of Italy) and WEAM4i (EU project) are platforms that provide advice to farmers based on water availability. They do not offer practical information nor site-specific for nitrates pollution management or an integrated risk assessment with associated cost analysis.  \f     PAGE |8   FIELDVIEW, developed by the Climate Corporation (US company), has developed an App that supports farmers with modelling-base recommendations of the most suitable agronomic managements related with water irrigation, fertilization and a short-term forecast analysis of risks and costs. However, Fieldview:  does not include the long-term climate variability, pollution constraints, or watershed management data, among others AND  does not offer a personalized service ad-hoc for each farm.   Agrimanager by the Spanish company Bynse is an App to keep a track record of farm operations. It also offers rather generic recommendations for crops based on its growth stage (not in its actual status or needs). With SMARTQUA, we will perform modelling simulations, taking into account not only meteorological data and economic indicators, but also soil properties and crop management providing personalized recommendations.  VisualNacert is specialized software for agriculture designed for improving efficiency and productivity in agricultural business. It is mainly a planning tool that helps to keep track of the activities of the farm and organizes a wide range of information into a graphical interface. However, the tool does not provide recommendation services based on predictive scientific models.   SigAGROasesor is a Spanish public management tool focused on the sustainable use of pesticides. It is a rather generic tool with limited services, not aimed at providing decision support to farmers.  To demonstrate the novelty of SMARTQUA, in the following table, we show a schematic comparison between SMARTQUA and the solutions above-mentioned:  Table 1. Comparisson with the state-of-the-art  App available Irrigation management Risk mitigation plans Support to comply with the EU regulation Ad-hoc service Scope PRICE Irriframe      ITALY 0.20 €/ha WEAM4I      EU N/A Fieldview       Global 7 €/ha Agrimanager        Spain 24 €/ha VisualNacert       Global 1,800 €/year SigAGROasesor      Spain Free       Global First 5 years: 5.5 €/ha Onwards: 1.25 €/ha After comparing SMARTQUA with state-of-the-art solutions, we can conclude that our solution offers the best-value-for-money due to the following Unique Selling Points:   Personalized service, ad-hoc for each farm. Even if other platforms offer similar services, SMARTQUA is the only platform available that does it on a per-farm basis and considering all possible variables affecting the decision process.   Wide array of services within the same platform (irrigation management, risk mitigation, regulation compliance… and more to be included during the commercialization).   35 % savings on water use, 25 % on energy and 25 % on fertilizers, resulting in savings of up to 550 €/ha (results proven on real farms).  Why now? The perfect moment to launch SMARTQUA to the market.  There are different conditions creating the perfect scenario to launch SMARTQUA to the market:  Ever-increasing pressure over water use. Due to climate change, water will become both: a scarcer resource and, at the same time, even more crucial due to periods of thermal stress. In this context, solutions aimed \f     PAGE |9  at making an efficient use of water will become essential to guarantee farm’s rentability and water preservation.   Water pricing policy: the European Water Directive 2000/60 states that the price of water must consider its scarcity as a resource and the impact over the environment, and that consumers should pay according to the volume consumed in order to foster an efficient use. This has meant and will mean increases on the water bill for farmers, which ultimately motivate farmers to invest in technologies for improving water management3.  Stringent EU regulation. Over the past years, the CAP has been turning to a greener approach. The cross-compliance requirements have become stricter and new payment schemes such as the “greening”4 were introduced in the last reform. The CAP post-2020 will continue in this line, with a higher ambition over environmental and climate action5. Thus, farmers will have to deal with a stricter EU regulation, that increase the administrative burden and make more complex farm management.  Fast growing penetration of ICT in farming. Contrary to what it may seem ICT applications are rapidly expanding among the farming community. 1 out of 4 farmers already use some kind of smart farming technology6 and market projections show an increasing penetration (the CAGR of the smart farming market is of 12 % until 2025), which highlights farmers’ willingness to pay for ICT tools.  1.3 Stage of development History and current development state   Previous projects The development of SMARTQUA started in 2016. SMARTQUA settles its basis on technical knowledge and direct experience acquired through the following projects (further details are included in section 4):   2013- 2016: Life Nitrates. EU funded project under the Life programme. It had a budget of 2.4 M€ and gathered 4 partners, who hired the advice of GeoSLab as a subcontractor. Its main aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of actions plans outlined to meet the Nitrates Directive.   2013- 2015: OPTINAGUA. Project funded by the European Regional Development Funds. It gathered 3 partners (GeoSLab, our linked third party AMALTEA and the University of Zaragoza). It had a total budget of 0.5 M€ € and its main aim was to develop a software tool for auditing the efficiency of water and energy management in agro-food industries;  2015-2017: FREEWAT. Horizon 2020 Collaborative Project with a 1.6 M€ budget aimed at promoting water management and planning by simplifying the application of the Water Framework Directive and other EU water directives. It gathered 18 partners, including AMALTEA – link third party of this project.  These projects have delivered key know-how regarding efficient use of water in agriculture, water management, risk-management in agriculture, nitrates pollution and EU regulation as well as of development of software tools to support farmers and public authorities in decision making processes regarding these concepts.   Current status of development  SMARTQUA consists on developing a platform that integrates already developed digital platforms and data from different sources. These are:  - HYDROSPATIUM: Spatial Data Infraestructure (SDI) that provides georeferenced information of the availability and quality of water. This tool was developed by GeoSLab (together with our linked third party AMALTEA) and is already being used by the                                                              3 Giannakis, Elias & Bruggeman, Adriana & Djuma, Hakan & Jerzy, Kozyra & Hammer, Juerg.

This tool has been developed by GeoSLab and 7-eData (we have an exploitation contract available in Annex 3). It already has more than 12,000 users (i.e. farmers) and its being a success: since its market launch in 2014, revenues generated have grown exponentially (e.g. by 60 % between 2017 and 2018).  - AQUATOOL: Decission Support System (DSP) for for planning and management of basins and water systems. It was developed by the Polytechnic University of Valencia and we have a licensing agreement in place (see Annex 3). It is corrently being used by all the 9 Hydrographic Conederations in Spain and by 50 private consultancy companies in Europe (Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Turkey and Bosnia), North Africa (Morocco and Algeria) and Latin America (Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and Argentina).  Consequently, our project SMARTQUA is currently in a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, as main components integrating the platform are already developed and they have proved its correct functioning under real environmental conditions. However, as it is further explained below, we still need to carry out a complex integration work, develop the user interface, as well as to test the integrated components in real environmental conditions.   Steps planned to reach the TRL8  In order to reach the TRL-8 during the SME-Instrument Phase 2, we have scheduled a 24-month work-plan with a total budget of 2 M€. Main activities to be carried out are:   Integration and optimization of SMARTQUA components (WP1). This includes the integration of the different software components (HYDROSPATIUM, AQUATOOL and AGROSLAB) within SMARTQUA platform + the integration of the hardware components (sensors, SCADA and remote information systems). Once integrated, we will conduct small trials in semi-operational conditions (Watering Community of Alto Aragon, which is the largest watering community in the EU, see Letter of Commitment in Annex 3). Based on the feedback obtained, SMARTQUA Beta Version will be obtained.   Qualification of SMARTQUA to reach commercial version (WP2). Large scale pilots in Spain (at least 10 farms) and Portugal (at least 5 farm) under real conditions will take place.  For a 9-month period, we will gather in-field information that will be used to run SMARTQUA hydrological, agronomic and climatic simulation models. This way, we will validate in a real environment our solution’s coherence of the results calculated by the models (irrigation, pesticides and fertilizer optimization + drought forecasting and management). Feedback will be used to fine-tune the platform and reach the commercial version.   Preparation for commercialization and exploitation (WP3). During the whole project we will carry out business development activities such as meetings with stakeholders (public authorities, specialized agencies…), organization of workshops and focus groups with target users (farmers), communication through social media…   SMARTQUA certification (WP3). We consider that building trust is a key element for a successful recognition and adoption of our solutions. Therefore, SMARQUA results will be certified by an independent certification body. This certification will be used to demonstrate technical performances, under an accredited verified scheme. The key parameter that will be verified is the number of irrigation operations with zero infiltration of lixiviates (excess of irrigation waters fertilizers and pesticides). The verification process will be applied to one pilot test farm in Spain (80 ha) where two sections will be monitored: one under SMARTQUA services and other one without as a baseline reference. Phase II Specific Objectives  The overall aim of the SMARTQUA Phase 2 project is to reach the market readiness (TRL8) in order to launch our platform to the market right after project end and to build a commercial network in order to assure a successful market uptake. To do so, the specific objectives of the project are: \f     PAGE |11  General objectives Specific objectives Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Main activities Milestones To integrate and optimize SMARTQUA components To integrate technological components of SMARTQUA To adapt the online platform for SMARTQUA operation To demonstrate the system in operational conditions 100% of component running under a unified platform.

SMARTQUA 1.1. released  M5: Certification granted  1.4 Feasibility and risks Technological, practical and economic feasibility SMARTQUA was granted a SME-Instrument Phase 1 (November 2016 – February 2017), thorough which we proved our project’s technical, commercial and financial viability. Main results were:   Technical Results: consolidation of stipulations and procedures for the integration of the different components of SMARTQUA + elaboration of a work plan to perform all necessary tasks during a 2-years’ time frame. Calculation of funding requirements.   Commercial Results:  with the support of the Coaching Services provided by the European Commission, we acquired a better understanding of the smart farming market and size, identified trends and opportunities and developed our go-to-market strategy. Trials in farms have proven in a real environment the feasibility of our solution In the following chart we show a comparison of the water balance in an 18-ha maize field irrigated by an experienced farmer (brown bars) and the same field following SMARTQUA’s assessment (blue bars). As it can be seen, in this practical case water savings were of ≈50 %, so the 35 % value that we are giving is a conservative one. Moreover, infiltration is significantly reduced by ≈ 70 %, which means a proportional reduction in nitrates lixiviation.   Figure 4. Corn field \f     PAGE |12   These exciting results have been proven and validated several times in real conditions (i.e. a “real farm”) in the context of the Life Nitrates Life project, the FREEWAT H2020 project and more recently in the Nitrates Cooperation Group within the context of the ongoing Rural Development Programme of the Government of Aragon. Thus, we are fully confident of its reliability and impact.  Risks & barriers We are aware of the importance of considering in advance all possible risks and barriers, in order to design proper mitigation measures and contingency plans. To that aim, we have considered risks related to bring SMARTQUA to the market, barriers for a successful market uptake and potential risks during the commercialization stage. Hereon we present them.

IMPACT 2.1 Market and customers TARGET MARKET Our solution is part of the “smart farming market”, which was worth globally 6.8 B€ in 2018 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12 % until 2025, reaching a value of 15.4 B€ by then7.  Within this market, we are targeting the “farm management software market”, that accounted for a 19 % share of the “smart agriculture market” in 2018. This niche is expected to grow at a higher pace, with a CAGR of 17 % until 2025. Thus, the value of the “farm management software market” will be of 4.22 B€ and will account for a share of 25 % of the overall “smart agriculture market” by 20258.  Drivers of this market are the need to shift to more efficient farming methods able to cope with the challenges that the agricultural sector is facing, including enhancing climate change resilience and feeding a growing population without jeopardizing natural resources (e.g. water resources quantity and quality).  TARGET USERS Our target users can be segmented in two different groups: farmers and insurance companies/banks. Below we describe each of them and highlight their willingness to pay for SMARTQUA.  Segment of clients 1: Farmers The first segment of target users are farmers, especially those in irrigable land. In the EU there are 11 million agricultural holdings that covered an area of 180 million ha9. Of it, 120 million ha (65 %) are arable crops and permanent crops (the remaining land is permanent grassland, so not part of our target). Approximately 11 % of the 120 million ha is irrigable land (equivalent to 20 million ha), of which 95 % is located in Mediterranean countries (Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and France)10. Thus, our primary target are farmers in those 5 Mediterranean countries.  The structure of EU farms is very heterogeneous regarding size and farmers’ age. To delimit our target users, we have decided to address first high added value and water demanding crops:   Vegetables: 2.2 million ha and 1 million holdings in the EU. Italy (20 %), Spain (17 %), Poland (11 %) and France (11 %) accounted for 60 % of the land devoted to vegetables11.   Citrus fruits: 1.3 million ha, mainly located in Spain.   Olives: 4.6 million ha and 1.8 million holdings in the EU. Spain (55 %), Italy (23 %) and Greece (15 %) gather more than 90 % of the EU land devoted to olives12.   Vineyards: 3.2 million ha and 2.5 million holdings in the EU. Spain (30 %), France (25 %) and Italy (20 %) accounted for over three-quarters of the total EU vineyard area.  The overall aim of any farmer is to obtain the maximum yield of better quality possible with a minimal use of agricultural inputs (mainly water, energy and fertilizer), in order to perceive the highest profit. However, farming is an economic activity where long-term predictions usually fail. Farming is strongly affected by weather, volatile prices, natural disasters, pests and diseases, which result that every year, at least 20 % of farmers lose more than 30 % of their income compared with the average of the last three years1. In this context, SMARTQUA is a solution fully aligned with farmers need as it contributes to increase efficiency and obtain higher profit through savings in water, energy and fertilizers use as well as through a risk reduction (e.g. by selecting the most appropriate crops and seeding density according to SMARTQUA’s water availability calculations).                                                               7 Markets and Markets (2019).

LINK.  10 European Commission (2019) Land cover and land use. LINK.  11 Eurostat. LINK.  12 Eurostat. LINK.  \f     PAGE |15  Below, we present a CASE STUDY for different types of crops (vegetables, citrus fruits, olives and vineyards) to show the impact that the implementation of SMARTQUA has over our clients and to prove farmers’ willingness to pay for our solution.   CONCLUSION: the investment to benefit from all the functionalities of SMARTQUA is of 5.5 €/month during the first 5 years (to cover the costs of installation) and 1.25 €/month the following years (PREMIUM subscription). Thus, during the first 5 years the expenditure in SMARTQUA for a 100-ha farmer is of 32,500 €.  However, since the total economic savings (water + energy + fertilizer) after 5 years thanks to our solution range from 100 k€ in the case of vineyards to 276 k€ in the case of vegetables, it is clear that SMARTQUA is a highly profitable investment.  Under this scenario the payback for the farmer is not even one year: depending on the crop it ranges from less than 2 months for vegetables and citrus fruits, 3 months for olives and 4 months for vineyards.  Segment of clients 2: insurance companies and banks offering insurance services The second segment of target users are insurance companies and banks that provide insurance products for agricultural business. Their main concern is reducing risk of their insurance policies. To do so, they need to have access to the most updated information that allows predicting more accurately the likelihood of a risk happening. Based on that information, they can adjust insurances’ prices to maximize benefits and avoid losses. By leveraging the power of Big Data, SMARTQUA generates accurate and complete reports highly valuable for insurance companies/banks to assess risks’ likelihood and impact. The reports will be customizable for each client, and they will detail for different crops in different regions, the likelihood of the different risks (drought, heat wave, frost, hail, floods…). Each report will cost 2,000 € and there will be yearly subscriptions including 4 reports per year at 5,000 €.  We won’t address that segment until the third year in the market. Thus, during the SME Instrument Phase 2 will evaluate more this segment (clients’ pain, market trends, commercialization plan…) in order to better define a strategy to successfully reach them.  Benchmarking We will offer very high-quality decision support system with an affordable price within the market of smart agriculture. SMARTQUA is a more cost-effective solution than our competitors, since it is much more Table 2.

In Table 2, we compare the prices against the most similar solutions available. As noted before, SMARTQUA has the following UNIQUE SELLING POINTS:   Personalized service, ad-hoc for each farm, with a simple calibration we obtain maximum accuracy.   One-stop-shop-platform: wide array of services within the same platform (irrigation management, risk mitigation, regulation compliance… and more to be included during the commercialization).   35 % savings on water use, 25 % on energy and 25 % on fertilizers, resulting in savings of up to 550 €/ha (results proven on “real farms”).  2.2 Commercialisation strategy Revenue streams Our business model is a B2B (business-to-business) based on the following revenue streams:  1. Fees from farmers purchasing SMARTQUA services. We offer three different levels of subscription:  - FREE service is free of charge and provides non-customized recommendations based on open data.  - BASIC service, with a yearly fee of 0.8 € per hectare & month, delivers non-customized recommendations based on agronomical and hydrological models, depending on regional data and conditions.    - PREMIUM service provides customized recommendations for farm management based on information gathered from the field. The fee is of 5.5 € per hectare & month during the first five years and 1.25 € per hectare & month onwards. The higher costs during the first five years are related to the higher cost of deployment associated to premium services (i.e. soil samples analyses, placing of sensors, models calibration…).  2. Business Intelligences. Fees from insurance companies/banks buying SMARTQUA reports at 1,000 €/each. There will be different options adapted to the needs of our clients:  - Year subscription: 1 report every 3 months at 5,000 €/year - Individual annual report: 2,000 € Commercialization plan  To commercialize SMARTQUA and consolidate our international expansion, we will create a network of local partners with whom we will establish an exploitation agreement. The typical profile of these local partners is an agricultural consultancy company with an established position in its region. There will at least one local partner per target country, and they will be the ambassadors of SMARTQUA in that country. They will receive training from our team and their role will be mainly commercial, consisting on engaging and following-up users. Additionally, they will also provide support during the initial deployment of SMARTQUA in premium users’ farms, as this task requires the placing of sensors to calibrate the simulation models and analysing soil samples to evaluate the soil hydraulic properties (local partners will need to place correctly the sensors and send soil samples to acknowledged laboratories, while the calibration of the models will be done remotely by our team). On exchange, they will perceive a 30 % of the profit generated by their portfolio of farmers (actual percentage will be negotiated on an individual basis).  We have already started to build this international network, an indeed two potential members have expressed their support, commitment and interest in the project in the letters attached in Annex 3. They are TeaSistemi (Italian environmental consultancy company that delivers customized solutions, advance SW and consultancy services) and SIMBIENTE (Portuguese technological company, focused on research, development, innovation and services related to environmental engineering and biotechnology areas). The latter will also be involved in the project as a subcontractor to perform trials in Portuguese farms.   \f     PAGE |17  In Spain, our partner company ZETA AMALTEA (involved in the project as linked third party) will assume the role of a local partner. To reach target users, they won’t follow a farmer-by-farmer strategy as it wouldn’t be cost-effective. On the contrary, they will address cooperatives, irrigation communities or other types of farmers’ organizations that gather several farmers under their umbrella. Besides, farmers’ advisors would be another pathway to reach them, as one single advisor would a portfolio of 10-15 farms.  The commercialization plan can be divided in 3 main stages:  2022  Market deployment. Market deployment will take place during the first year after the project end and includes activities to shift from a TRL8 to a TRL9. These activities consist mainly on the creation of the network of local partners in different EU countries. First, we will target EU Mediterranean countries (Spain, Italy, Portugal, France and Greece) as these area is more prone to suffer from drought and thus the willingness to pay for SMARTQUA is higher. During the first year, we foresee that more than 130,000 ha will be covered by SMARTQUA. 2023 – 2024  Consolidation of the European network. During these two years, we will focus on creating a strong position at European level, expanding our network of local partners and multiplying the number of users. By 2024, we foresee that more than 650,000 ha will be already covered by SMARTQUA and the yearly gross margin will be higher than 4 M€.  2025-2026  Expansion to third countries and diversification. From 2025, we will initiate our expansion towards countries outside the EU, either Latin American countries such as Colombia and Peru (we already have a support letter from the Peruvian Water Competence Centre available in Annex 3) or South Mediterranean countries with a strong agricultural sector such as Turkey or Morocco (actual target countries will be based on an exhaustive market study). As with the EU countries, a network of local partners will be created. Moreover, as from 2025 we will already have enough critical mass of big data (more than 500,000 ha), we will launch the Business Intelligence services in Europe. A targeted marketing strategy will be designed for each bank or insurance companies, to design ad-hoc solutions adapted to their specific needs. Among other, we will approach the following entities: UniCreditGroup, BBVA, Deutsche Bank, IBERCAJA, KUTXABANK, AGROBANK (from CaixaBank), Banco Sabadell, Allianz, AXA and CASER. Regulatory requirements.  We are fully aware of the importance of a responsible data use. Exploitation of SMARTQUA algorithms and big data will be strictly limited by current EU legislation. In order to have a solid background on big data exploitation, we will contract an Attorney that will review legal requirements for algorithms and big data exploitation for SMARTQUA services.  Main regulations applicable are:  Environmental EU regulations – Nitrates Directive 91/67, Water Framework Directive 2000/60, Floods Directive 2007/60, Groundwater Directive 2006/118, Common Agriculture Policy.  ISO 31000:2009. Risk management – Principles and guidelines.  ISO 22301:2012. Societal security—Business continuity management systems --- Requirements.   Data sharing regulations: INSPIRE Directive 2007/02.  Big data: Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. 2.3 External Strategic Partners Different external strategic partners will be required during the development and commercialization of SMARTQUA. These are:   ZETA AMALTEA. GeoSLab’s linked third party. AMALTEA is an environmental consultancy company expert on integrated water resources management, water and natural resources planning and climate risk analyses among others. GeoSLab and AMALTEA have a track record of joined collaboration and indeed, both companies share a common shareholder (Mr. Miguel Garcia owns 37.50 % of GeoSLab and 50 % of AMALTEA). We share common interests and are complementary to one another: GeoSLab is specialized in digital processing and modelling of geospatial and georeferenced information and advanced software and mobile Apps development while AMALTEA is specialized in the application of this ICT solutions to agriculture and water planning and management. Their role in SMARTQUA consist on:  \f     PAGE |18  - Support during the SME Instrument Phase 2 project development, complementing GeoSLab’s team with their background in water and farm management. They will mainly carry out “the field work” (small scale pilot of Task 1.5 and organization / coordination of the large-scale pilots of WP2).  - After the end of the project, AMALTEA will be involved in SMARTQUA’s exploitation as a member of our network of local partners.   SUBCONTRACTORS. Three subcontractors will be involved during the Phase 2 project execution:  - Two of them (the ADVANCED INFORMATION SYSTEMS LABORATORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ZARAGOZA and the UNIVERSITY OF VALENCIA) will be involved during WP1 “to support on hardware / software integration tasks.  - The other is SIMBIENTE, who will support on the organization of the large-scale pilots in Portugal.  All subcontractors have expressed their commitment in the project in the letters of interest collected in Annex 3. More detailed information of them is available at the end of Section 3.6 “resources”.     LOCAL PARTNERS. As already explained, we will create a network of local partners in different EU and third countries to commercially exploit SMARTQUA. Two of these local partners are actually involved in the project (AMALTEA and SIMBIENTE) and another one (TEA SISTEMI) has expressed their support to it (see Annex 3).  2.4 Intellectual property Freedom To Operate We have analysed the Freedom of Operate (FTO) of SMARTQUA during our Feasibility Study. Our analysis includes a patent search in order determine if one or more patents could potentially limit a SMARTQUA’s freedom to operate in our targeted markets. As a result, we have not identified any patent with which SMARTQUA could be confronted. Nevertheless, during the WP3 an attorney expert in IPR will be hired for three months for preparing and in-deep analyses of SMARTQUA’s FTO.  Intellectual Property Rights strategy We plan to register SMARTQUA mark in Europe and target Latin American countries (mainly Colombia and Peru) and South Mediterranean countries (probably Turkey and Morocco). Further actions will be considered with the basis of the conclusions of our in-deep IPR analysis (Task 3.4). Since SMARTQUA is based on the integration of different software solutions, a patent application is not an option (Article 52 of the EPC13 excludes software from patentability). However, the European level Directive 2009/24 allows Member States to protect computer software by copyright. Hence, SMARTQUA software is protected under copyright. To enjoy such protection, no registration or other formality is required. Copyright protection is granted from the sole fact of the creation of the program14.  Besides, GeoSLab’s employees sign a Non-disclosure agreement and Non-compete agreement to guarantee that the core company’s ideas remain unveiled. 2.5 Scale up potential  Scalability of our model.  The reasons why SMARTQUA is an easy scalable business are manifold:  Easily adaptable to other countries/contexts: it is important to note that SMARTQUA doesn’t need to undergo any adaptation to be sold in different countries (apart from translating the software to the local language which is a minor task that doesn’t imply any technical challenge). Sensors installation will be done by local partner – official calibrators – and this will be the only personnel dedication required to ensure the functioning of SMARTQUA in any place in Europe.   Commercialization strategy based on key multipliers: we will create a network of international local partners in each target country that will allow the fast deployment of SMARTQUA. After only 5 years in the market, we expect to have reached at least 5 EU countries + either Latin American and South                                                              13 European Patent Convention 14 European IPR Help Desk (2016) Copyright or Patent – how to protect my software?  \f     PAGE |19  Mediterranean countries. In addition, we will target multipliers such as farmers’ cooperatives or farmers’ associations.  Fast growth: the gross margin of SMARTQUA increases from 33 % the first year in the market to more than 50 % the fifth year in the market. This way, revenues in SMARTQUA’s business model rapidly outpace expenses. In another words, our business has the potential to multiply revenue with minimal incremental costs (Figure 6).  Impact of SMARTQUA over GeoSLab  In Table 3 we show projections of SMARTQUA revenue, COGS (costs of goods sold) and gross margin for the first five commercialization years.  As it can be seen, it is a highly profitable project. After five years of commercialization, it will generate an accumulated revenue of 27 M€. All economic indicators deliver highly promising results:  - The Return of Investment (ROI) is of 6.37 - The Net Present Value (NPV) is of 12.2 M€  - The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is of 70 % Moreover, the project will contribute to the creation of 36 job positions.  Even though the first year we will have a negative result (which will be covered with GeoSLab own resources and a bank loan, as it is further explained in Section 3.2), revenue will grow at a considerably higher pace than costs, so that the second year we have a positive gross margin.  Regarding the MARKET SHARE, if we consider as our total addressable market the land allocated to vegetables, citrus fruits, olives and vineyards in Europe (11.3 M ha) and that by the fifth year of commercialization almost 670,000 ha will be covered by SMARTQUA service, we will capture a market share of almost 6 % which will represent an estimated income of more than 10 M€ by the fifth year of commercialization.    2.6 Key Performance Indicators In the following table we present a list of KPIs for the expected outcome sand the related baseline and target values, with the expected date of achievement of the target value:  KPI Units Baseline value Target value Target date SMARTQUA coverage Nº hectares covered by SMARTQUA - > 150,000 ha Year 2 > 500,000 ha Year 4 20222023202420252026ACCUMULATEDNº hectares 138,581              253,405         415,743            538,487            673,108            673,108              Free79,189                158,378         237,568            316,757            395,946            395,946              Basic39,595                55,432           118,784            142,541            158,378            158,378              Premium19,797                39,595           59,392              79,189              118,784            118,784              REVENUE (M€)1,682,771          3,127,973     5,128,312        6,892,704        10,264,731      27,096,490        Free (0 €/ha)-                       -                  -                     -                     -                     -                       Basic (10 €/ha)395,946              554,324         1,187,838        1,425,406        1,583,784        5,147,298          Premium (65 €/ha)1,286,825          2,573,649     3,860,473.50  5,147,298        7,720,947        20,589,192        Business Intelligence-                       -                  80,000              320,000            960,000            1,360,000          COGS (M€)1,121,517          1,600,810     2,279,902        2,860,495        4,492,947        12,355,671        Free19,797                39,595           59,392              79,189              98,986.50        296,960              Basic 39,595                55,432           118,784            142,541            158,378            514,730              Premium821,588              851,284         880,979.85      910,676            1,761,960        5,226,487          Commision local partners240,537              654,499         1,220,746.79  1,728,089        2,473,622        6,317,494          GROSS MARGIN 561,253              1,527,164     2,848,409        4,032,209        5,771,784        14,740,819        33%49%56%58%56%54%Table 3.

This is fully aligned with the EU’s aim of “ensuring a fair standard of living for farmers, especially through the increase of their income”.  Indeed, the cornerstone of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) is to enhance the competitiveness and viability of farming, in order to guarantee the sustainability of this strategical sector.   SMARTQUA increases climate change resilience: climate change effects are already noticeable and the situation is only projected to worsen. The agriculture sector is seriously affected by the unfortunate changes (droughts, floods, heat waves…) and there is a consensus at European and global level that it is of utmost important to fosters its resilience in order to guarantee its survival. In this context, SMARTQUA arises a strategic tool to ease the adaptation of farming to climate change, thanks to the efficient water management that allows to maintain yields whilst minimizing water (and inputs) use.   SMARTQUA takes care of the enviornment: thanks to SMARTQUA, water quality and quantity will be improved. On the one hand, nitrates leakage is reduced by 70 % and on the other, our solution assures water savings of almost 160,000 m3 per 100 ha and year, which is equivalent to nothing less than 50 Olympic pools.  3. IMPLEMENTATION 3.1 Team and capabilities GeoSLab’s count with a multidisciplinary and experienced team of 14 employees combining different backgrounds in computing engineering, water, environmental and agricultural management and business development (see their CVs in Annex 2). This balanced combination of profiles, guarantees that the know-how necessary to bring SMARTQUA to the market and make a success of it are already in place. Nevertheless, we are aware of the importance of bringing new talents to our team that would strengthen our capabilities. For this reason, during the Phase 2, we aim to hire one expert on strategy and business internationalization to guarantee that our developments are always market oriented. Moreover, in order to face the post-project commercialization stage, we will also hire sales agents in charge of creating and following-up the international network of local partners.  We would like to highlight that the two major shareholders of GeoSLab, Ms. Susana Zarazaga and Mr. Miguel Garcia (see Table 4), will be fully involved in the project, taking respectively the roles of commercial coordinator and overall project coordinator.

Our team \f     PAGE |22  3.2 Financing needs The funding requirements to launch SMARTQUA to the marker are of 1.6 M€ and the time-to-market is of 2 years (equivalent to the budget and duration of the Phase 2).  To co-finance the 30 % of the budget not covered by the EU grant and to carry out the market deployment activities (from TRL8 to TRL9, estimated financing needs of 300,000 €) we will allocate our own-resources as well as we are already negotiating a bank loan from the Spanish bank Agrobank from CaixaBank. 3.3 Need for EIC support In GeoSLab we are fully committed to the development of SMARTQUA. This means that we are willing to allocate our own-resources, coming from other revenue streams of the company, in its development. However, the EIC support would be of strategic importance four our project.  On the one hand, it would allow us to reach the market much quicker, which is of key importance in order to get the first mover advantage.  On the other hand, thanks to the EIC support, we will be able to carry out a more ambitious go-to-market strategy, including the deployment of large scale pilots in Spain (at least 10 farms) and Portugal (at least 5 farm) under real conditions. This would allow us to reach the market with a much powerful product, with consolidated sales arguments and thus with a higher likelihood to obtain a successful market uptake.  Last but not least, it is widely acknowledged that the SME Instrument program is highly competitive and only the best projects attain it. This gives to the company and to the project itself international reputation and contributes to build trust with potential users.  3.4 Risks In section 1.4 we have provided an exhaustive overview of risk related to the project execution, barriers related to a successful market uptake and post-project risks; together with mitigation measures for each of them. In short:  - Risks identified during the Phase 2 project execution are mainly technical, more specifically, related to a performance lower than expected. Mitigation measures consist on designing and running tests (e.g. integration or stress tests) from the very beginning of the project, to monitor at all times performance. The large scale pilots are also the perfect strategy to detect and fix in advance weak points that may arise under real working conditions.  - Barriers identified to obtain a successful market uptake are mainly related with farmers’ behaviour (mainly reluctance to adopt new technologies and low expertise to manage them). Mitigation measures include obtaining a quality seal granted by an independent certification body and offering personalized/online training and customer support services.  - Risk identified once SMARTQUA is already in the market are, among others, related with data security or issues with the servers. Mitigation measures consists on establishing the highest security standards (e.g. encryption protocols) and the deployment of multiple, redundant servers to maintain continuous operations.  3.5 Approach For the project execution and with the aim of reaching the TRL8 by the end of the project, we have outlined a 24-month work-plan organized in 4 work-packages.  In the following page, we show a GANTT chart with the outline of the project.    \f     PAGE |23    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 WP1.

            "     PAGE |2  INTRODUCTION Basic information  Company description GeoSLab (legal full name of GeoSpatiumLab SL) is a high-tech Spanish SME specialized in digital processing and modelling of geospatial and georeferenced information and in the development of advanced software and mobile Apps with an especial focus on water and farm management.  To guarantee the interoperability and scalability of our solutions, we work following international standards such as the INSPIRE Directive. Thus, our developments can function on their own or together with other software building more potent and integrated systems.  We have a wide portfolio of clients, ranging from public authorities (Hydrographic confederations and Spanish national and regional bodies) to private companies (mainly environmental consultancy or engineering companies). We develop ad-hoc solutions for these entities (e.g. we are the developers of the water information systems of Oman and of the Spanish region of Álava) as well as we develop our own-solutions to be commercially exploited by us. An example is AGROSLAB, a web platform to support farmers with the application of pesticides and fertilizers on farms and support on regulatory requirements of the CAP. It already has more than 12,000 users and its being a complete success: since its market launch in 2014, revenues generated have grown exponentially (e.g. by 60 % between 2017 and 2018).  Summary  Description of the innovation Farming is a complex activity, strictly regulated, that suffers from many risks (weather events…). As in any business, farmers aim at obtaining the highest profit, by making an optimized input use (water, fertilizer…) whilst complying with the regulation.  Lately there have arisen different ICT tools to ease farm management (e.g. smart irrigation systems). However, the lack of integration, homogenization and interoperability hinders the full exploitation of the smart farming concept.  With SMARTQUA, we are bringing the smart farming concept to the next level. Our solution represents digitally and resolves the complexity of farming sector. Based on the concept of meta-platform, it (i) integrates different platforms, (ii) gathers information from the farm and from external sources and (iii) runs advanced simulation models, to solve in an efficient manner main farmers’ pain points.  The advantages of SMARTQUA include:  1. Accurate irrigation management that reaches 35 % water savings, which means 25 % savings in energy and fertilizers.  2. Ad-hoc risk mitigation plans to reduce losses by 50 % (e.g. selection of the most appropriate crops according to water availability forecasts).  3. Hassle-free compliance with EU regulation by providing the mechanisms and recommendations to comply with it.   Relation of the innovation with the overall strategy of the beneficiary SMARTQUA is fully aligned with GeoSLab’s strategy, as this project will allow us to capitalize the knowledge and expertise obtained previously in geodata management, use of highly advanced predictive models for environmental, agronomic and climatic risk assessment and design and implementation of information systems. All these elements: data from sensors, remote sensing, official sources… + predictive models + other specialized software; are key components of SMARTQUA that now will work together for a science-based solution that is at the same time, user-friendly and comprehensive.   As a result, we will deliver to the market a cost-efficient and high-performance meta-platform for farmers that will outperform current solutions in the market and will democratize the access to and sharing of knowledge. The development and marketing of SMARTQUA will have a strong impact in our company. The commercialization of this new solution will be translated into fast company growth and market positioning in the sector of smart farming systems. Thanks to SMARTQUA we will consolidate our national and international expansion, as we will reach different EU countries (mainly Spain, Italy, Portugal, France and Greece) and Latin America. Moreover, our company’s EBITDA will increase from nearly 150 k€ (2018) to more than 1 M€ (2024) thanks to the exploitation of SMARTQUA. \f\n",

            "     PAGE |3  1. EXCELLENCE 1.1 Idea and solution The relevance of farming The EU’s agricultural sector is of vital importance for our society: it guarantees food security for over 500 million European citizens and creates 22 million jobs directly and 44 million indirectly1. Due to their great importance, almost 40 % of the EU’s budget is allocated to support farming through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), that subsidizes farming through direct payments and other payment schemes.  The complexity of farming Farming is a highly complex activity, in which multiple factors must be taken into account. Main PAIN POINTS faced by farmers are:   Low income: despite the utmost importance of farming, overall farming is not a highly profitable business. Indeed, the average farmers’ income is around 40% lower compared to non-agricultural income2. In this context, it is of vital importance for farmers to make the best possible allocation of resources (i.e. optimize use of inputs such as irrigation water, fertilizers, energy, pesticides…) in order to maximize yield while assuring the profitability of the business.   Risk management: farming is also a risky activity, as it is strongly affected by unforeseen weather events (droughts, frost…), volatile prices, natural disasters, pests and diseases. As a result, every year one fifth of farmers suffer an income drop of 30 %1.   Strict regulation: EU farming has one of the strictest regulations worldwide. In order to receive direct payments, farmers must comply with the CAP’s cross-compliance requisites which are related to 18 legislative requirements (e.g. Nitrates Directive, Sustainable Use of Pesticides…) and “good agricultural and environmental conditions” (e.g. conservation of soil’s organic matter to avoid erosion). As a result, farmers must watch out each and every operation they carry out: irrigation, fertilization, pesticides use, land management… in order to comply with the EU regulation and receive direct payments. The smart farming revolution presents usability problems for farmers In the last years, there have arisen a multitude of smart solutions and ICT tools aimed at easing farm management: smart irrigation systems, SW platforms for pesticides or fertilizers use and keep a track record of applications, information systems about the status (quantity and quality) of water reservoirs…  These solutions are intended to be helpful for farmers, but we have reached to a point in which options available are so diverse, that they could even become a burden for farmers that need to deal with many different tools and Apps, each with a different purpose. There is a lack of integration and interoperability, which ultimately results in a lack of user-friendly solutions and an obstacle to fully exploit the smart farming potential.   Our solution SMARTQUA Our solution SMARTQUA is a meta-platform or, in another words, a platform of platforms. Based on geolocation and dynamic transfer of key elements related to agronomic production, it brings the smart farming concept to the next level. To do so, we integrate different platforms with a proven track record, gather in-field and external information (e.g. soil properties, EU regulation in force…) and make use of advanced simulation models. This way, we offer farmers the first one-stop-shop digital platform of platforms where they can find in a single place the tools that they need for an efficient farm management. It is an expert system that generates new knowledge and value at an exponential rate.  Simply put, SMARTQUA transfer to a digital dimension all the elements, relationships and balances found in an agricultural system, with the aim of enhancing farmers’ competitiveness whilst minimizing the environmental impact.                                                               1 European Commission (2017).

            "     PAGE |4  The services that will be first provided by SMARTQUA are divided in three pillars below explained, each addressing one of our clients’ (i.e. farmers) main pain points.  PILLAR 1: Irrigation and fertilization management for an optimized input use (water, energy and fertilizers).  SMARTQUA calculates accurately irrigation doses, frequency and timing, contributing to a significant reduction on input optimization. Based on trials done in real farms (further explain in section 1.4 “feasibility and risks”), we have proven water savings of more than 35 %, which is translated into energy savings of 25 % (as less energy is required to pump the water) and fertilizer savings of 25 % (as optimal irrigation doses mean that there is not a generation of surplus water that would drain down and wash nutrients). Considering water and energy prices in a Mediterranean country like Spain, up to 550 €/ha can be saved per year thanks to the implementation of our solution.   For farmers having/willing to have an automatic irrigation controller with internet connectivity (IoT), thanks to the interoperability of tour system we offer the possibility of connecting our platform with the controller, so that the recommendations provided by SMARTQUA are directly sent to the controller and farmers don’t need to bother to program it manually.  PILLAR 2: Risk mitigation to minimize losses.  SMARTQUA monitors potential risks both weather related (drought, frost, pests…) and market related (drops on prices due to overproductions) and the likelihood of them happening so action can be taken on time and losses can be reduced by 50 %. Some practical examples of the application of this functionality are:   RISK: Drought forecast  SOLUTION: by analysing with advanced simulation models information coming from weather generators, status of water reservoirs, climatic scenarios and expected water demand on the region, SMARTQUA calculates water availability during the growing season so that periods of drought can be seen in advance to plan the season accordingly. This is translated into the selection of drought-resistant varieties/crops and the optimal seeding density.   RISK: Price fluctuations  SOLUTION: by analysing global harvest forecasts (prices & yield) and crops’ cost structure (inputs and labour required); SMARTQUA recommends the best crops to be planted according to a cost-effectiveness criterion (i.e. crops that would yield the maximum profit in the market, considering costs incurred during its production).    RISK: Alerts  SOLUTION: by monitoring in-real time environmental factors affecting farming (temperature, humidity…) crops being grown, pesticides treatments applied… SMARTQUA foresees the appearance of sudden risks such as pests or frost and provides a customized mitigation plan; so that farmers can apply it right on time.   PILLAR 3: Hassle-free compliance with the EU regulation SMARTQUA monitors all the EU regulation affecting farming and provides farmers the mechanisms and recommendations to comply with it:   Nitrates Directive (91/676/ECC), aimed at protecting water against nitrates pollution from agricultural sources and whose compliance is mandatory in order to receive fully CAP’s direct payments. One of the main cause of nitrates pollution is the use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers, as nitrates forming in the soil would leach with the drainage water and reach water bodies. Because SMARTQUA tells the exact amount of water required in each moment, this minimizes the amount of drainage water by 70%. Consequently, nitrates leaching is negligible and compliance with the Nitrates Directive is guaranteed. To validate our solution, an independent certification body will certify that SMARTQUA avoids nitrates pollution, so that farmers using our solution can be confident that by following SMARTQUA recommendations, they would meet the cross-compliance requirements regarding the Nitrates Directive.  Sustainable use of Pesticides Directive (2009/128). SMARTQUA tells the best amount and moment to apply a pesticide, keeps a track record of pesticides applied and warns about the “security time-frame” (i.e. days between an application and harvest time) and any other regulatory issue stated in the EU Directive 2009/128 for a sustainable management of pesticide use and the correspondent national regulations. Since compliance with the above-mentioned regulation is also mandatory in order to meet the cross-compliance criteria, this functionality is also key to perceive entirely the CAP direct payments.  \f\n",
            "\n",
            "     PAGE |5  This functionality will be powered through the implementation of the own-developed tool AGROSLAB, that already has more than 12,200 users in Spain.  Other regulations affecting specific farms. There are other regulations that apply only to certain farms (e.g. if a farmer is receiving payments from CAP’s second pillar regarding “agri-environment-climate” measures or placed within the Natura 2000 areas among others, he/she will have stricter limitations regarding pesticides and other inputs use). With SMARTQUA we monitor all regulations that apply specifically to each farm and keep farmers updated, in a comprehensive manner, of each and every regulatory issue that they must consider.  The potential of our solution is recognized by several public and private entities (see Letters of Interest from 14 stakeholders in Annex 3) and has been proven under real environmental conditions during the Feasibility Study conducted during the Phase 1. Certification of SMARTQUA to enhance farmers’ willingness to buy and competitiveness  SMARTQUA’s capabilities to reduce the environment impact of agriculture will be certified under an independent certification body. Based on the “Codes of Good Agricultural Practices” published by the Ministries of Agriculture of the different EU countries, we will identify measures to which SMARTQUA contributes positively (mainly related to water savings, fertilizer savings and nitrates pollution prevention). For each measure identified, we will establish target values (e.g. less than 600 m3 of water per tonne of maize produced or no more than 50 kg/ha of complex NPK 15:15:15 fertilizer) and the external certification body will audit the validation of SMARTQUA to achieve these target values (during Task 3.6).  This will result in a “quality seal” granted by an acknowledged certification body, recognized by farmers and stakeholders of the farming sector.  This will increase our target clients’ willingness to pay for SMARTQUA as this certification will:   Enhance farmers’ trust in the potential of our solution, as the outcomes delivered by our solution would have been validated by an external body  Increase farmers’ competitiveness as large retailers that lead the food market are the more and more seeking for agricultural products produced in sustainable manner, in order to meet consumers’ demands of environmentally friendly food products.   DNV GL (Norwegian) and TÜV Rheinland (German), certification bodies operating each in more than 100 countries, have already positively assessed the feasibility of this certification.   Future developments SMARTQUA’s capabilities are unlimited, as our aim is to progressively develop and integrate new functionalities to facilitate dynamic learning and adaptation to changing conditions of market markets, climate or regulation among others. The agri-food sector is undergoing a revolution enabled by the application of ICT technologies to farming. Smart tractors, drones, technology 4.0, augmented reality… are some examples that are changing the landscape of farming. We are aware that we are targeting a very dynamic sector and that, in order to stay ahead of the competition, is key to stay updated and incorporate the latest trends into our solution. In this sense, SMARTQUA itself is a dynamic platform in which we are considering the implementation of further functionalities that would enhance continuously the valued delivered by our solution. Some examples in our roadmap are:   Integration with smart tractors (Figure 2), that track land operations such as pesticides treatments (type of pesticide applied and dose) so that the mandatory track record of pesticides treatments is automatically created, and farmers don’t need to introduce the data manually.   Use of drones, artificial intelligence and augmented reality capabilities to map farms, detect key points and fix them (Figure 3). For example, different colouring of crops is an indicator of uneven nutrients intake by plants. Considering that average farm size in the EU is of 16 ha, it is extremely difficult to detect accurately these differences at ground level and by the human-eye, Figure 2. Tractors are becoming increasingly complex Figure 3. Drones & augmented reality opens a whole new world for farming \f\n",
            "\n",
            "     PAGE |6  but with the application of drones and artificial intelligence even slight changes of colour can be spotted, so that corrective measures can be applied (i.e. level the land, change fertigation program…) to maximize yield. The advanced processing of geolocated information contributes decisively to boost “maximum precision agriculture”. In addition, as of the third year in the market, we will launch the business intelligence service. It will target companies and banks that offer agricultural insurances to farmers to protect their crops against weather or other risks. For these companies, it is of utmost important to know the likelihood of a risk happening in order to charge the most cost-effective price to farmers. SMARTQUA business intelligence service will offer accurate reports, covering different crops and risks (drought, frost, hail…) and specific for each region (the actual content of each report will be defined by each client).  How is SMARTQUA delivered? As we further explain in section 2, SMARTQUA’s users can choose among three different subscription options: FREE BASIC PREMIUM Free 0.80 €/ha & month First 5 years: 5.5 €/ha & month Onwards: 1.25 €/ha & month Fees will be paid under yearly subscriptions. Non-customized recommendations based on open data. Non-customized recommendations based on agronomical and hydrological models, depending on regional data and conditions. Fully customized recommendations for farm management, taking into account information gathered from the field. According to our calculations, approximately 60 % of our users will be free, 25 % basic and 15 % premium. Even though free users don’t provide directly a revenue, it is highly interesting to have them within our platform, as they create critical mass and we can leverage the data provided by them (farm location, crops being grown…) to offer further services based on Big Data analyses. Indeed, from the third year in the market we will launch the “business intelligent services” revenue stream. It targets agricultural insurance companies and banks offering insurance coverage to farmers, that would benefit from detail reports through which they can know the likelihood of a risk happening and adjust insurances’ prices accordingly.  How does SMARTQUA work? SMARTQUA platform uses data from different external sources and from the farm, and digests it through already developed tools and making use of agronomic, hydrological and climatic simulation models. All input data is processed following the INSPIRE Directive (2007/2/EC) (data sharing, interoperatibility and standardisation) to ensure that data is compatible and usable. In the following chart, we show a schematic representation of SMARTQUA functioning:   \f\n",
            "\n",
            "     PAGE |7  How is SMARTQUA deployed? For BASIC and PREMIUM users SMARTQUA offers a personalized service (ad-hoc for each farm). To do so, its commissioning requires a process of deployment and calibration of simulation models that consists on the following:   Placing of sensors. Selection 1-2 points per hectare to place soil humidity sensors (only for calibration purposes).   Soil hydraulic properties. Soil sampling (1-2 per ha) and laboratory analyses to determine its texture, organic matter content and density and, based in these properties and by making use of pedotransfer functions, obtain the soil hydraulic properties (i.e. the behaviour of water in the soil such as moisture retention).   Coupling with the smart irrigation controller already in-place (if available).   Data analysis and calibration of the simulation models. During a whole growing season, the simulation models will be calibrated by comparing data from the sensors and delivered from the models themselves. This is done remotely from our premises in Spain. Once the system is calibrated, the sensors can be removed.   Training of farmers on SMARTQUA. To that aim, we will create tutorial videos in the local language. To offer such a personalized service, technical personnel in the field will be required. Hence, to guarantee the scalability and international expansion of SMARTQUA, we will create an international network of local partners that will support us on the deployment of SMARTQUA and also will carry out commercial activities (engaging and following-up farmers). 1.2 Innovativeness Our unique approach Our approach is based on providing a highly-advanced tool at a competitive price. In SMARTQUA we make use of the most up to date tools, simulation models and geospatial processing of all variables and parameters that affect farming management.  The key innovation of SMARTQUA is the integration and dynamic interoperability of own-developed and existing tools with a wide curated and high-quality array of information in the frame of a meta-platform. In our company we’ve been working for 12 years on developing information systems, mainly based on the concept of Spatial Data Infrastructures, for key players such as Governments (e.g. Oman), local authorities or private entities. Now we have integrated all this know-how in the design and development of SMARTQUA to provide farmers access to a reliable system adapted to their specific conditions but at the same time connected in a global network. We are leveraging the power of the information and data available (status of water reservoirs, weather information, harvest forecasts…) and tools already developed which are currently underexploited.  By crossing all this information with the specific situation of each farm, and using advanced simulation models, we are able to offer high level consultancy services at a very low cost.   This way, the agri-food chain will become more competitive, resilient, environmentally friendly and better connected to the markets thanks to significant savings in water, energy and fertilizers and larger and better-quality harvests. Beyond the State of the art In the state-of-the-art there are different platforms related with the smart farming concept, which are either public or private initiatives. Each of them addresses a different pain point faced by farmers, but none use a holistic approach to offer in a single platform an integrated solution as we do. Below, we highlight some of these solutions in the state-of-the-art:  IRRIFRAME (public initiative from the ministry of agriculture of Italy) and WEAM4i (EU project) are platforms that provide advice to farmers based on water availability. They do not offer practical information nor site-specific for nitrates pollution management or an integrated risk assessment with associated cost analysis.  \f\n",
            "\n",
            "     PAGE |8   FIELDVIEW, developed by the Climate Corporation (US company), has developed an App that supports farmers with modelling-base recommendations of the most suitable agronomic managements related with water irrigation, fertilization and a short-term forecast analysis of risks and costs. However, Fieldview:  does not include the long-term climate variability, pollution constraints, or watershed management data, among others AND  does not offer a personalized service ad-hoc for each farm.   Agrimanager by the Spanish company Bynse is an App to keep a track record of farm operations. It also offers rather generic recommendations for crops based on its growth stage (not in its actual status or needs). With SMARTQUA, we will perform modelling simulations, taking into account not only meteorological data and economic indicators, but also soil properties and crop management providing personalized recommendations.  VisualNacert is specialized software for agriculture designed for improving efficiency and productivity in agricultural business. It is mainly a planning tool that helps to keep track of the activities of the farm and organizes a wide range of information into a graphical interface. However, the tool does not provide recommendation services based on predictive scientific models.   SigAGROasesor is a Spanish public management tool focused on the sustainable use of pesticides. It is a rather generic tool with limited services, not aimed at providing decision support to farmers.  To demonstrate the novelty of SMARTQUA, in the following table, we show a schematic comparison between SMARTQUA and the solutions above-mentioned:  Table 1.

Even if other platforms offer similar services, SMARTQUA is the only platform available that does it on a per-farm basis and considering all possible variables affecting the decision process.   Wide array of services within the same platform (irrigation management, risk mitigation, regulation compliance… and more to be included during the commercialization).   35 % savings on water use, 25 % on energy and 25 % on fertilizers, resulting in savings of up to 550 €/ha (results proven on real farms).  Why now? The perfect moment to launch SMARTQUA to the market.  There are different conditions creating the perfect scenario to launch SMARTQUA to the market:  Ever-increasing pressure over water use. Due to climate change, water will become both: a scarcer resource and, at the same time, even more crucial due to periods of thermal stress. In this context, solutions aimed \f\n",
            "\n",
            "     PAGE |9  at making an efficient use of water will become essential to guarantee farm’s rentability and water preservation.   Water pricing policy: the European Water Directive 2000/60 states that the price of water must consider its scarcity as a resource and the impact over the environment, and that consumers should pay according to the volume consumed in order to foster an efficient use. This has meant and will mean increases on the water bill for farmers, which ultimately motivate farmers to invest in technologies for improving water management3.  Stringent EU regulation. Over the past years, the CAP has been turning to a greener approach. The cross-compliance requirements have become stricter and new payment schemes such as the “greening”4 were introduced in the last reform. The CAP post-2020 will continue in this line, with a higher ambition over environmental and climate action5. Thus, farmers will have to deal with a stricter EU regulation, that increase the administrative burden and make more complex farm management.  Fast growing penetration of ICT in farming. Contrary to what it may seem ICT applications are rapidly expanding among the farming community. 1 out of 4 farmers already use some kind of smart farming technology6 and market projections show an increasing penetration (the CAGR of the smart farming market is of 12 % until 2025), which highlights farmers’ willingness to pay for ICT tools.  1.3 Stage of development History and current development state   Previous projects The development of SMARTQUA started in 2016. SMARTQUA settles its basis on technical knowledge and direct experience acquired through the following projects (further details are included in section 4):   2013- 2016: Life Nitrates. EU funded project under the Life programme. It had a budget of 2.4 M€ and gathered 4 partners, who hired the advice of GeoSLab as a subcontractor. Its main aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of actions plans outlined to meet the Nitrates Directive.   2013- 2015: OPTINAGUA. Project funded by the European Regional Development Funds. It gathered 3 partners (GeoSLab, our linked third party AMALTEA and the University of Zaragoza). It had a total budget of 0.5 M€ € and its main aim was to develop a software tool for auditing the efficiency of water and energy management in agro-food industries;  2015-2017: FREEWAT. Horizon 2020 Collaborative Project with a 1.6 M€ budget aimed at promoting water management and planning by simplifying the application of the Water Framework Directive and other EU water directives. It gathered 18 partners, including AMALTEA – link third party of this project.  These projects have delivered key know-how regarding efficient use of water in agriculture, water management, risk-management in agriculture, nitrates pollution and EU regulation as well as of development of software tools to support farmers and public authorities in decision making processes regarding these concepts.   Current status of development  SMARTQUA consists on developing a platform that integrates already developed digital platforms and data from different sources. These are:  - HYDROSPATIUM: Spatial Data Infraestructure (SDI) that provides georeferenced information of the availability and quality of water. This tool was developed by GeoSLab (together with our linked third party AMALTEA) and is already being used by the                                                              3 Giannakis, Elias & Bruggeman, Adriana & Djuma, Hakan & Jerzy, Kozyra & Hammer, Juerg.

This tool has been developed by GeoSLab and 7-eData (we have an exploitation contract available in Annex 3). It already has more than 12,000 users (i.e. farmers) and its being a success: since its market launch in 2014, revenues generated have grown exponentially (e.g. by 60 % between 2017 and 2018).  - AQUATOOL: Decission Support System (DSP) for for planning and management of basins and water systems. It was developed by the Polytechnic University of Valencia and we have a licensing agreement in place (see Annex 3). It is corrently being used by all the 9 Hydrographic Conederations in Spain and by 50 private consultancy companies in Europe (Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Turkey and Bosnia), North Africa (Morocco and Algeria) and Latin America (Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and Argentina).  Consequently, our project SMARTQUA is currently in a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, as main components integrating the platform are already developed and they have proved its correct functioning under real environmental conditions. However, as it is further explained below, we still need to carry out a complex integration work, develop the user interface, as well as to test the integrated components in real environmental conditions.   Steps planned to reach the TRL8  In order to reach the TRL-8 during the SME-Instrument Phase 2, we have scheduled a 24-month work-plan with a total budget of 2 M€. Main activities to be carried out are:   Integration and optimization of SMARTQUA components (WP1). This includes the integration of the different software components (HYDROSPATIUM, AQUATOOL and AGROSLAB) within SMARTQUA platform + the integration of the hardware components (sensors, SCADA and remote information systems). Once integrated, we will conduct small trials in semi-operational conditions (Watering Community of Alto Aragon, which is the largest watering community in the EU, see Letter of Commitment in Annex 3). Based on the feedback obtained, SMARTQUA Beta Version will be obtained.   Qualification of SMARTQUA to reach commercial version (WP2). Large scale pilots in Spain (at least 10 farms) and Portugal (at least 5 farm) under real conditions will take place.  For a 9-month period, we will gather in-field information that will be used to run SMARTQUA hydrological, agronomic and climatic simulation models. This way, we will validate in a real environment our solution’s coherence of the results calculated by the models (irrigation, pesticides and fertilizer optimization + drought forecasting and management). Feedback will be used to fine-tune the platform and reach the commercial version.   Preparation for commercialization and exploitation (WP3). During the whole project we will carry out business development activities such as meetings with stakeholders (public authorities, specialized agencies…), organization of workshops and focus groups with target users (farmers), communication through social media…   SMARTQUA certification (WP3). We consider that building trust is a key element for a successful recognition and adoption of our solutions. Therefore, SMARQUA results will be certified by an independent certification body. This certification will be used to demonstrate technical performances, under an accredited verified scheme. The key parameter that will be verified is the number of irrigation operations with zero infiltration of lixiviates (excess of irrigation waters fertilizers and pesticides). The verification process will be applied to one pilot test farm in Spain (80 ha) where two sections will be monitored: one under SMARTQUA services and other one without as a baseline reference. Phase II Specific Objectives  The overall aim of the SMARTQUA Phase 2 project is to reach the market readiness (TRL8) in order to launch our platform to the market right after project end and to build a commercial network in order to assure a successful market uptake. To do so, the specific objectives of the project are: \f\n",

Main results were:   Technical Results: consolidation of stipulations and procedures for the integration of the different components of SMARTQUA + elaboration of a work plan to perform all necessary tasks during a 2-years’ time frame. Calculation of funding requirements.   Commercial Results:  with the support of the Coaching Services provided by the European Commission, we acquired a better understanding of the smart farming market and size, identified trends and opportunities and developed our go-to-market strategy. Trials in farms have proven in a real environment the feasibility of our solution In the following chart we show a comparison of the water balance in an 18-ha maize field irrigated by an experienced farmer (brown bars) and the same field following SMARTQUA’s assessment (blue bars). As it can be seen, in this practical case water savings were of ≈50 %, so the 35 % value that we are giving is a conservative one. Moreover, infiltration is significantly reduced by ≈ 70 %, which means a proportional reduction in nitrates lixiviation.   Figure 4. Corn field \f\n",

            "     PAGE |12   These exciting results have been proven and validated several times in real conditions (i.e. a “real farm”) in the context of the Life Nitrates Life project, the FREEWAT H2020 project and more recently in the Nitrates Cooperation Group within the context of the ongoing Rural Development Programme of the Government of Aragon. Thus, we are fully confident of its reliability and impact.  Risks & barriers We are aware of the importance of considering in advance all possible risks and barriers, in order to design proper mitigation measures and contingency plans. To that aim, we have considered risks related to bring SMARTQUA to the market, barriers for a successful market uptake and potential risks during the commercialization stage. Hereon we present them.

IMPACT 2.1 Market and customers TARGET MARKET Our solution is part of the “smart farming market”, which was worth globally 6.8 B€ in 2018 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12 % until 2025, reaching a value of 15.4 B€ by then7.  Within this market, we are targeting the “farm management software market”, that accounted for a 19 % share of the “smart agriculture market” in 2018. This niche is expected to grow at a higher pace, with a CAGR of 17 % until 2025. Thus, the value of the “farm management software market” will be of 4.22 B€ and will account for a share of 25 % of the overall “smart agriculture market” by 20258.  Drivers of this market are the need to shift to more efficient farming methods able to cope with the challenges that the agricultural sector is facing, including enhancing climate change resilience and feeding a growing population without jeopardizing natural resources (e.g. water resources quantity and quality).  TARGET USERS Our target users can be segmented in two different groups: farmers and insurance companies/banks. Below we describe each of them and highlight their willingness to pay for SMARTQUA.  Segment of clients 1: Farmers The first segment of target users are farmers, especially those in irrigable land. In the EU there are 11 million agricultural holdings that covered an area of 180 million ha9. Of it, 120 million ha (65 %) are arable crops and permanent crops (the remaining land is permanent grassland, so not part of our target). Approximately 11 % of the 120 million ha is irrigable land (equivalent to 20 million ha), of which 95 % is located in Mediterranean countries (Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and France)10. Thus, our primary target are farmers in those 5 Mediterranean countries.  The structure of EU farms is very heterogeneous regarding size and farmers’ age. To delimit our target users, we have decided to address first high added value and water demanding crops:   Vegetables: 2.2 million ha and 1 million holdings in the EU. Italy (20 %), Spain (17 %), Poland (11 %) and France (11 %) accounted for 60 % of the land devoted to vegetables11.   Citrus fruits: 1.3 million ha, mainly located in Spain.   Olives: 4.6 million ha and 1.8 million holdings in the EU. Spain (55 %), Italy (23 %) and Greece (15 %) gather more than 90 % of the EU land devoted to olives12.   Vineyards: 3.2 million ha and 2.5 million holdings in the EU. Spain (30 %), France (25 %) and Italy (20 %) accounted for over three-quarters of the total EU vineyard area.  The overall aim of any farmer is to obtain the maximum yield of better quality possible with a minimal use of agricultural inputs (mainly water, energy and fertilizer), in order to perceive the highest profit. However, farming is an economic activity where long-term predictions usually fail. Farming is strongly affected by weather, volatile prices, natural disasters, pests and diseases, which result that every year, at least 20 % of farmers lose more than 30 % of their income compared with the average of the last three years1. In this context, SMARTQUA is a solution fully aligned with farmers need as it contributes to increase efficiency and obtain higher profit through savings in water, energy and fertilizers use as well as through a risk reduction (e.g. by selecting the most appropriate crops and seeding density according to SMARTQUA’s water availability calculations).                                                               7 Markets and Markets (2019).

            "     PAGE |15  Below, we present a CASE STUDY for different types of crops (vegetables, citrus fruits, olives and vineyards) to show the impact that the implementation of SMARTQUA has over our clients and to prove farmers’ willingness to pay for our solution.   CONCLUSION: the investment to benefit from all the functionalities of SMARTQUA is of 5.5 €/month during the first 5 years (to cover the costs of installation) and 1.25 €/month the following years (PREMIUM subscription). Thus, during the first 5 years the expenditure in SMARTQUA for a 100-ha farmer is of 32,500 €.  However, since the total economic savings (water + energy + fertilizer) after 5 years thanks to our solution range from 100 k€ in the case of vineyards to 276 k€ in the case of vegetables, it is clear that SMARTQUA is a highly profitable investment.  Under this scenario the payback for the farmer is not even one year: depending on the crop it ranges from less than 2 months for vegetables and citrus fruits, 3 months for olives and 4 months for vineyards.  Segment of clients 2: insurance companies and banks offering insurance services The second segment of target users are insurance companies and banks that provide insurance products for agricultural business. Their main concern is reducing risk of their insurance policies. To do so, they need to have access to the most updated information that allows predicting more accurately the likelihood of a risk happening. Based on that information, they can adjust insurances’ prices to maximize benefits and avoid losses. By leveraging the power of Big Data, SMARTQUA generates accurate and complete reports highly valuable for insurance companies/banks to assess risks’ likelihood and impact. The reports will be customizable for each client, and they will detail for different crops in different regions, the likelihood of the different risks (drought, heat wave, frost, hail, floods…). Each report will cost 2,000 € and there will be yearly subscriptions including 4 reports per year at 5,000 €.  We won’t address that segment until the third year in the market. Thus, during the SME Instrument Phase 2 will evaluate more this segment (clients’ pain, market trends, commercialization plan…) in order to better define a strategy to successfully reach them.  Benchmarking We will offer very high-quality decision support system with an affordable price within the market of smart agriculture. SMARTQUA is a more cost-effective solution than our competitors, since it is much more Table 2.

In Table 2, we compare the prices against the most similar solutions available. As noted before, SMARTQUA has the following UNIQUE SELLING POINTS:   Personalized service, ad-hoc for each farm, with a simple calibration we obtain maximum accuracy.   One-stop-shop-platform: wide array of services within the same platform (irrigation management, risk mitigation, regulation compliance… and more to be included during the commercialization).   35 % savings on water use, 25 % on energy and 25 % on fertilizers, resulting in savings of up to 550 €/ha (results proven on “real farms”).  2.2 Commercialisation strategy Revenue streams Our business model is a B2B (business-to-business) based on the following revenue streams:  1. Fees from farmers purchasing SMARTQUA services. We offer three different levels of subscription:  - FREE service is free of charge and provides non-customized recommendations based on open data.  - BASIC service, with a yearly fee of 0.8 € per hectare & month, delivers non-customized recommendations based on agronomical and hydrological models, depending on regional data and conditions.    - PREMIUM service provides customized recommendations for farm management based on information gathered from the field. The fee is of 5.5 € per hectare & month during the first five years and 1.25 € per hectare & month onwards. The higher costs during the first five years are related to the higher cost of deployment associated to premium services (i.e. soil samples analyses, placing of sensors, models calibration…).  2. Business Intelligences. Fees from insurance companies/banks buying SMARTQUA reports at 1,000 €/each. There will be different options adapted to the needs of our clients:  - Year subscription: 1 report every 3 months at 5,000 €/year - Individual annual report: 2,000 € Commercialization plan  To commercialize SMARTQUA and consolidate our international expansion, we will create a network of local partners with whom we will establish an exploitation agreement. The typical profile of these local partners is an agricultural consultancy company with an established position in its region. There will at least one local partner per target country, and they will be the ambassadors of SMARTQUA in that country. They will receive training from our team and their role will be mainly commercial, consisting on engaging and following-up users. Additionally, they will also provide support during the initial deployment of SMARTQUA in premium users’ farms, as this task requires the placing of sensors to calibrate the simulation models and analysing soil samples to evaluate the soil hydraulic properties (local partners will need to place correctly the sensors and send soil samples to acknowledged laboratories, while the calibration of the models will be done remotely by our team). On exchange, they will perceive a 30 % of the profit generated by their portfolio of farmers (actual percentage will be negotiated on an individual basis).  We have already started to build this international network, an indeed two potential members have expressed their support, commitment and interest in the project in the letters attached in Annex 3. They are TeaSistemi (Italian environmental consultancy company that delivers customized solutions, advance SW and consultancy services) and SIMBIENTE (Portuguese technological company, focused on research, development, innovation and services related to environmental engineering and biotechnology areas). The latter will also be involved in the project as a subcontractor to perform trials in Portuguese farms.   \f\n",

            "     PAGE |17  In Spain, our partner company ZETA AMALTEA (involved in the project as linked third party) will assume the role of a local partner. To reach target users, they won’t follow a farmer-by-farmer strategy as it wouldn’t be cost-effective. On the contrary, they will address cooperatives, irrigation communities or other types of farmers’ organizations that gather several farmers under their umbrella. Besides, farmers’ advisors would be another pathway to reach them, as one single advisor would a portfolio of 10-15 farms.  The commercialization plan can be divided in 3 main stages:  2022  Market deployment. Market deployment will take place during the first year after the project end and includes activities to shift from a TRL8 to a TRL9. These activities consist mainly on the creation of the network of local partners in different EU countries. First, we will target EU Mediterranean countries (Spain, Italy, Portugal, France and Greece) as these area is more prone to suffer from drought and thus the willingness to pay for SMARTQUA is higher. During the first year, we foresee that more than 130,000 ha will be covered by SMARTQUA. 2023 – 2024  Consolidation of the European network. During these two years, we will focus on creating a strong position at European level, expanding our network of local partners and multiplying the number of users. By 2024, we foresee that more than 650,000 ha will be already covered by SMARTQUA and the yearly gross margin will be higher than 4 M€.  2025-2026  Expansion to third countries and diversification. From 2025, we will initiate our expansion towards countries outside the EU, either Latin American countries such as Colombia and Peru (we already have a support letter from the Peruvian Water Competence Centre available in Annex 3) or South Mediterranean countries with a strong agricultural sector such as Turkey or Morocco (actual target countries will be based on an exhaustive market study). As with the EU countries, a network of local partners will be created. Moreover, as from 2025 we will already have enough critical mass of big data (more than 500,000 ha), we will launch the Business Intelligence services in Europe. A targeted marketing strategy will be designed for each bank or insurance companies, to design ad-hoc solutions adapted to their specific needs. Among other, we will approach the following entities: UniCreditGroup, BBVA, Deutsche Bank, IBERCAJA, KUTXABANK, AGROBANK (from CaixaBank), Banco Sabadell, Allianz, AXA and CASER. Regulatory requirements.  We are fully aware of the importance of a responsible data use. Exploitation of SMARTQUA algorithms and big data will be strictly limited by current EU legislation. In order to have a solid background on big data exploitation, we will contract an Attorney that will review legal requirements for algorithms and big data exploitation for SMARTQUA services.  Main regulations applicable are:  Environmental EU regulations – Nitrates Directive 91/67, Water Framework Directive 2000/60, Floods Directive 2007/60, Groundwater Directive 2006/118, Common Agriculture Policy.  ISO 31000:2009. Risk management – Principles and guidelines.  ISO 22301:2012. Societal security—Business continuity management systems --- Requirements.   Data sharing regulations: INSPIRE Directive 2007/02.  Big data: Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. 2.3 External Strategic Partners Different external strategic partners will be required during the development and commercialization of SMARTQUA. These are:   ZETA AMALTEA. GeoSLab’s linked third party. AMALTEA is an environmental consultancy company expert on integrated water resources management, water and natural resources planning and climate risk analyses among others. GeoSLab and AMALTEA have a track record of joined collaboration and indeed, both companies share a common shareholder (Mr. Miguel Garcia owns 37.50 % of GeoSLab and 50 % of AMALTEA). We share common interests and are complementary to one another: GeoSLab is specialized in digital processing and modelling of geospatial and georeferenced information and advanced software and mobile Apps development while AMALTEA is specialized in the application of this ICT solutions to agriculture and water planning and management. Their role in SMARTQUA consist on:  \f\n",
            "\n",
            "     PAGE |18  - Support during the SME Instrument Phase 2 project development, complementing GeoSLab’s team with their background in water and farm management. They will mainly carry out “the field work” (small scale pilot of Task 1.5 and organization / coordination of the large-scale pilots of WP2).  - After the end of the project, AMALTEA will be involved in SMARTQUA’s exploitation as a member of our network of local partners.   SUBCONTRACTORS. Three subcontractors will be involved during the Phase 2 project execution:  - Two of them (the ADVANCED INFORMATION SYSTEMS LABORATORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ZARAGOZA and the UNIVERSITY OF VALENCIA) will be involved during WP1 “to support on hardware / software integration tasks.  - The other is SIMBIENTE, who will support on the organization of the large-scale pilots in Portugal.  All subcontractors have expressed their commitment in the project in the letters of interest collected in Annex 3. More detailed information of them is available at the end of Section 3.6 “resources”.     LOCAL PARTNERS. As already explained, we will create a network of local partners in different EU and third countries to commercially exploit SMARTQUA. Two of these local partners are actually involved in the project (AMALTEA and SIMBIENTE) and another one (TEA SISTEMI) has expressed their support to it (see Annex 3).  2.4 Intellectual property Freedom To Operate We have analysed the Freedom of Operate (FTO) of SMARTQUA during our Feasibility Study. Our analysis includes a patent search in order determine if one or more patents could potentially limit a SMARTQUA’s freedom to operate in our targeted markets. As a result, we have not identified any patent with which SMARTQUA could be confronted. Nevertheless, during the WP3 an attorney expert in IPR will be hired for three months for preparing and in-deep analyses of SMARTQUA’s FTO.  Intellectual Property Rights strategy We plan to register SMARTQUA mark in Europe and target Latin American countries (mainly Colombia and Peru) and South Mediterranean countries (probably Turkey and Morocco). Further actions will be considered with the basis of the conclusions of our in-deep IPR analysis (Task 3.4). Since SMARTQUA is based on the integration of different software solutions, a patent application is not an option (Article 52 of the EPC13 excludes software from patentability). However, the European level Directive 2009/24 allows Member States to protect computer software by copyright. Hence, SMARTQUA software is protected under copyright. To enjoy such protection, no registration or other formality is required. Copyright protection is granted from the sole fact of the creation of the program14.  Besides, GeoSLab’s employees sign a Non-disclosure agreement and Non-compete agreement to guarantee that the core company’s ideas remain unveiled. 2.5 Scale up potential  Scalability of our model.  The reasons why SMARTQUA is an easy scalable business are manifold:  Easily adaptable to other countries/contexts: it is important to note that SMARTQUA doesn’t need to undergo any adaptation to be sold in different countries (apart from translating the software to the local language which is a minor task that doesn’t imply any technical challenge). Sensors installation will be done by local partner – official calibrators – and this will be the only personnel dedication required to ensure the functioning of SMARTQUA in any place in Europe.   Commercialization strategy based on key multipliers: we will create a network of international local partners in each target country that will allow the fast deployment of SMARTQUA. After only 5 years in the market, we expect to have reached at least 5 EU countries + either Latin American and South                                                              13 European Patent Convention 14 European IPR Help Desk (2016) Copyright or Patent – how to protect my software?  \f\n",
            "\n",
            "     PAGE |19  Mediterranean countries. In addition, we will target multipliers such as farmers’ cooperatives or farmers’ associations.  Fast growth: the gross margin of SMARTQUA increases from 33 % the first year in the market to more than 50 % the fifth year in the market. This way, revenues in SMARTQUA’s business model rapidly outpace expenses. In another words, our business has the potential to multiply revenue with minimal incremental costs (Figure 6).  Impact of SMARTQUA over GeoSLab  In Table 3 we show projections of SMARTQUA revenue, COGS (costs of goods sold) and gross margin for the first five commercialization years.  As it can be seen, it is a highly profitable project. After five years of commercialization, it will generate an accumulated revenue of 27 M€. All economic indicators deliver highly promising results:  - The Return of Investment (ROI) is of 6.37 - The Net Present Value (NPV) is of 12.2 M€  - The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is of 70 % Moreover, the project will contribute to the creation of 36 job positions.  Even though the first year we will have a negative result (which will be covered with GeoSLab own resources and a bank loan, as it is further explained in Section 3.2), revenue will grow at a considerably higher pace than costs, so that the second year we have a positive gross margin.  Regarding the MARKET SHARE, if we consider as our total addressable market the land allocated to vegetables, citrus fruits, olives and vineyards in Europe (11.3 M ha) and that by the fifth year of commercialization almost 670,000 ha will be covered by SMARTQUA service, we will capture a market share of almost 6 % which will represent an estimated income of more than 10 M€ by the fifth year of commercialization.    2.6 Key Performance Indicators In the following table we present a list of KPIs for the expected outcome sand the related baseline and target values, with the expected date of achievement of the target value:  KPI Units Baseline value Target value Target date SMARTQUA coverage Nº hectares covered by SMARTQUA - > 150,000 ha Year 2 > 500,000 ha Year 4 20222023202420252026ACCUMULATEDNº hectares 138,581              253,405         415,743            538,487            673,108            673,108              Free79,189                158,378         237,568            316,757            395,946            395,946              Basic39,595                55,432           118,784            142,541            158,378            158,378              Premium19,797                39,595           59,392              79,189              118,784            118,784              REVENUE (M€)1,682,771          3,127,973     5,128,312        6,892,704        10,264,731      27,096,490        Free (0 €/ha)-                       -                  -                     -                     -                     -                       Basic (10 €/ha)395,946              554,324         1,187,838        1,425,406        1,583,784        5,147,298          Premium (65 €/ha)1,286,825          2,573,649     3,860,473.50  5,147,298        7,720,947        20,589,192        Business Intelligence-                       -                  80,000              320,000            960,000            1,360,000          COGS (M€)1,121,517          1,600,810     2,279,902        2,860,495        4,492,947        12,355,671        Free19,797                39,595           59,392              79,189              98,986.50        296,960              Basic 39,595                55,432           118,784            142,541            158,378            514,730              Premium821,588              851,284         880,979.85      910,676            1,761,960        5,226,487          Commision local partners240,537              654,499         1,220,746.79  1,728,089        2,473,622        6,317,494          GROSS MARGIN 561,253              1,527,164     2,848,409        4,032,209        5,771,784        14,740,819        33%49%56%58%56%54%Table 3.

This is fully aligned with the EU’s aim of “ensuring a fair standard of living for farmers, especially through the increase of their income”.  Indeed, the cornerstone of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) is to enhance the competitiveness and viability of farming, in order to guarantee the sustainability of this strategical sector.   SMARTQUA increases climate change resilience: climate change effects are already noticeable and the situation is only projected to worsen. The agriculture sector is seriously affected by the unfortunate changes (droughts, floods, heat waves…) and there is a consensus at European and global level that it is of utmost important to fosters its resilience in order to guarantee its survival. In this context, SMARTQUA arises a strategic tool to ease the adaptation of farming to climate change, thanks to the efficient water management that allows to maintain yields whilst minimizing water (and inputs) use.   SMARTQUA takes care of the enviornment: thanks to SMARTQUA, water quality and quantity will be improved. On the one hand, nitrates leakage is reduced by 70 % and on the other, our solution assures water savings of almost 160,000 m3 per 100 ha and year, which is equivalent to nothing less than 50 Olympic pools.  3. IMPLEMENTATION 3.1 Team and capabilities GeoSLab’s count with a multidisciplinary and experienced team of 14 employees combining different backgrounds in computing engineering, water, environmental and agricultural management and business development (see their CVs in Annex 2). This balanced combination of profiles, guarantees that the know-how necessary to bring SMARTQUA to the market and make a success of it are already in place. Nevertheless, we are aware of the importance of bringing new talents to our team that would strengthen our capabilities. For this reason, during the Phase 2, we aim to hire one expert on strategy and business internationalization to guarantee that our developments are always market oriented. Moreover, in order to face the post-project commercialization stage, we will also hire sales agents in charge of creating and following-up the international network of local partners.  We would like to highlight that the two major shareholders of GeoSLab, Ms. Susana Zarazaga and Mr. Miguel Garcia (see Table 4), will be fully involved in the project, taking respectively the roles of commercial coordinator and overall project coordinator.

To co-finance the 30 % of the budget not covered by the EU grant and to carry out the market deployment activities (from TRL8 to TRL9, estimated financing needs of 300,000 €) we will allocate our own-resources as well as we are already negotiating a bank loan from the Spanish bank Agrobank from CaixaBank. 3.3 Need for EIC support In GeoSLab we are fully committed to the development of SMARTQUA. This means that we are willing to allocate our own-resources, coming from other revenue streams of the company, in its development. However, the EIC support would be of strategic importance four our project.  On the one hand, it would allow us to reach the market much quicker, which is of key importance in order to get the first mover advantage.  On the other hand, thanks to the EIC support, we will be able to carry out a more ambitious go-to-market strategy, including the deployment of large scale pilots in Spain (at least 10 farms) and Portugal (at least 5 farm) under real conditions. This would allow us to reach the market with a much powerful product, with consolidated sales arguments and thus with a higher likelihood to obtain a successful market uptake.  Last but not least, it is widely acknowledged that the SME Instrument program is highly competitive and only the best projects attain it. This gives to the company and to the project itself international reputation and contributes to build trust with potential users.  3.4 Risks In section 1.4 we have provided an exhaustive overview of risk related to the project execution, barriers related to a successful market uptake and post-project risks; together with mitigation measures for each of them. In short:  - Risks identified during the Phase 2 project execution are mainly technical, more specifically, related to a performance lower than expected. Mitigation measures consist on designing and running tests (e.g. integration or stress tests) from the very beginning of the project, to monitor at all times performance. The large scale pilots are also the perfect strategy to detect and fix in advance weak points that may arise under real working conditions.  - Barriers identified to obtain a successful market uptake are mainly related with farmers’ behaviour (mainly reluctance to adopt new technologies and low expertise to manage them). Mitigation measures include obtaining a quality seal granted by an independent certification body and offering personalized/online training and customer support services.  - Risk identified once SMARTQUA is already in the market are, among others, related with data security or issues with the servers. Mitigation measures consists on establishing the highest security standards (e.g. encryption protocols) and the deployment of multiple, redundant servers to maintain continuous operations.  3.5 Approach For the project execution and with the aim of reaching the TRL8 by the end of the project, we have outlined a 24-month work-plan organized in 4 work-packages.

On each, a baseline study will be conducted, containing water, energy and fertilizers consumptions or yield rates among others. For the organization of the pilots in Portugal, we will count with the support of a subcontractor to which we will provide a preparatory training.  Task 2.2. Installation and set-up of field equipment (sensors), in order to obtain high quality information of real operational conditions (e.g. soil moisture sensors and pluviometers). To guarantee a representative sample, tracking devices must be installed for a whole cropping cycle of nine months.  Task 2.3. Data processing (remote and on the field). This task refers to the process of getting information from the sensors installed on the farms (remote information) and through field trips (direct information). The information will be stored in our servers in order to guarantee its integrity. Additionally, soil samples from the field will be tested at AMALTEA’s premises using sensors and reproducing different farm conditions (heavy rain, drought…) to further calibrate the simulation models.   Task 2.4. Model simulation and validation. All data coming from Task 2.3 will be used for running SMARTQUA models. The results of this exercise will be compared with real conditions at the farm (validation of forecasting capabilities of our tool) and with the baseline study (validation of benefits such as savings of water, energy and fertilizers, among others).  Task 2.5. Climate risk assessment at farm level. It will be carried out following the principles and requirement of the international standard “ISO 31000:2009, Risk management – Principles and guidelines” and ISO 22301:2012 “Societal security—Business continuity management systems --- Requirements”. Our risk assessment will include physical risks (drought, flood and pollution) both at the farm and in the surrounding area; regulatory risks (new laws affecting the future our costumer´s business) and reputational risks (linked to market, mark image and socioeconomic environment). Task 2.6. Improvement of the platform and scaling-up. Fixing any problem raised during the pilot testing exercise (integrity of information, stability of the platform, etc.). In addition, we will improve the platform to make it operational and scalable up to any size of farm, geographic location, meteorological conditions or type of crop. As a result of this task, a SMARTQUA Platform Version 1.0 will be released.
